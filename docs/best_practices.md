# Best Practices for Voice Clone Application

## Code Quality

### Frontend
- Use functional React components with hooks
- Implement proper state management (React Context for app-wide state)
- Follow component composition patterns to maximize reusability
- Write JSDoc comments for all components and functions
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Ensure complete test coverage for critical components
- Use TypeScript for type safety throughout the application

### Backend
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Implement middleware pattern for cross-cutting concerns
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Follow the repository pattern for database operations
- Document all API endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Validate all incoming requests

## Security

- Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- Implement proper CORS settings
- Set secure and SameSite cookies
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Store passwords with bcrypt or Argon2 (for future auth implementation)
- Implement rate limiting on critical endpoints
- Use HTTPS for all connections
- Follow principle of least privilege for API permissions

## Performance

- Optimize asset loading with code splitting
- Implement caching strategies for API responses
- Use CDN for static assets
- Compress audio files appropriately
- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Optimize database queries with proper indexing
- Use connection pooling for database operations

## Monitoring and Logging

- Log all API requests and responses
- Implement structured logging
- Set up monitoring for critical operations
- Create alerts for system failures
- Track performance metrics
- Implement user activity auditing
- Monitor external service availability

## Voice Processing

- Validate audio file formats and quality before processing
- Implement proper error handling for external service failures
- Set timeouts for external API calls
- Use queue systems for long-running tasks
- Implement retries with exponential backoff
- Store processing results for reuse
- Validate synthesized audio quality

## User Experience

- Provide clear feedback during upload and processing
- Implement progress indicators for long operations
- Design for mobile-first with responsive layouts
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG compliance)
- Optimize for fast initial load
- Create clear error messages
- Implement offline capabilities for PWA
